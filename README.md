# California House Price Predictor 🏠

## 📝 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the median house value in California districts based on various features from the 1990 census data.

The pipeline involves:

  * **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling categorical features using one-hot encoding, and standardizing numerical features.
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for an `XGBoost Regressor` model.
  * **Model Training**: Training the model on the preprocessed data.
  * **Model Serialization**: Saving the trained model, the feature scaler, and the column layout for future use.
  * **Prediction**: A separate script loads the saved components to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **California Housing** dataset. Each row represents a census block group in California. The model is trained to predict the `median_house_value` based on features like median income, housing age, location (latitude/longitude), and ocean proximity.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files locally):**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    xgboost
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    joblib
    ```

    Then, install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 How to Use

The project is divided into two main parts: training the model and using it for prediction.

### Step 1: Train the Model

Run the `train.py` script. This script will perform all the preprocessing and training steps. Upon completion, it will save three files: `best_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, and `model_columns.pkl`.

```bash
python train.py
```

You should see output from the `GridSearchCV` process, followed by the model's performance metrics.

### Step 2: Make Predictions

Once the model and helper files are saved, you can use `predict.py` to get a prediction for a new house. You can modify the `input_data` dictionary within this script to predict on different data points.

```bash
python predict.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
The predicted house price is: 452600.0
```

## 📈 Model Performance

The model's performance on the test set after hyperparameter tuning is as follows:

  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** \~$29,805
  * **R-squared ($R^2$):** \~0.839

This indicates that the model can explain about **83.9%** of the variance in house prices and, on average, its predictions are off by about $29,805.

## 🔧 How It Works

1.  **Training (`train.py`)**:

      * The `housing.csv` data is loaded, and rows with missing values are dropped.
      * The categorical `ocean_proximity` feature is converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
      * The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure they have a similar range.
      * `GridSearchCV` exhaustively searches for the best `XGBoost` hyperparameters (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`, etc.) using 3-fold cross-validation.
      * The best-performing model, the scaler, and the column names are saved to disk using `joblib` for later use.

2.  **Prediction (`predict.py`)**:

      * The script loads the saved `best_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, and `model_columns.pkl`.
      * New input data is defined in a dictionary.
      * This new data undergoes the **exact same preprocessing steps** as the training data: it's one-hot encoded, its columns are aligned to match the model's expectations, and it's scaled using the loaded scaler.
      * The processed data is then fed into the model to generate a prediction.s
